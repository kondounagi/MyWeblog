Hi !  
Thank you for visiting my website.

I am an undergraduate student of [Department of Information and Communication](https://www.ee.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/j/), 
[Faculty of Engineering](https://www.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/foe/index.html), The University of Tokyo (Tokyo University).  
I belongs to [Aizawa Yamasaki Matsui Laboratory](http://www.hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/lab/en/index_1.xhtml), which mainly studies multimedia processing.  
Now I am doing graduation researching under associate professor [Toshihiko Yamasaki](https://www.hal.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamasaki/index-e.html).

I am intrested in societal implementation of technology, so I am working as CTO in [DeepEyeVision](https://deepeyevision.com).

I enjoy weight training as the vice captain of [B&W (Bodybuilding and Weightlifting club, Athletic Foundation of The University of Tokyo)](http://www.undou-kai.com/).

Anime is my reason of life.
